General Instructions

- This project is called Phaser Platformer DSL. It starts with a new repo. 
- Phaser Platformer DSL is a js project that uses a simple DSL to then generate phaser.js platformer games. 
- The DSL needs to use Ohm js. The lastest version of Phaser is a target. 
- The DSL for the platform should be simple but very expressive. 
- You have full control over the repo structure, the node modules you install and how you minify for a distribution. You'll need to update the .gitignore file. If you ever need to use .env files make sure that these can't be committed for privacy reasons. Just don't overwrite the prompts folder.
- When you plan, make sure you do functional decomposition, use appropriate design patterns and write tests. Incrementally commit to github. 
- Make sure there is an examples folder with examples that illustrate the functionality you build
- Make sure there is a dist folder with a minified version of the lib.
- Make sure the Readme.md file is up to date with how to install and use the lib 
- You are free to install libs that the project can use.
- You can use Typescript. Use functional JS concepts where appropriate. Design patterns and abstractions are extremely important to you. 
- Your aim: build the Phaser Platformer DSL and generator for latest Phaser.js version.
