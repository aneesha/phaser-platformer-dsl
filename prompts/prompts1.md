General Features of the Phaser Platformer DSL

- Phaser Platformer DSL allows game creators to build full featured multi-level platformers to reality. 
- It needs to make platformer game creation super simple but still allow for creativity (eg moving baddies, coin collection, game score display, end game criteria)

The main features include:
- DSL to define a platformer game. 
- Ohm.js should be used. 
- The generated game should use Phaser.js
- Multiple levels should be supported an well as importing tiled level maps (eg using layers and players to then define motion and rules etc)
- Create a DSL editor which renders the game in a side panel. 
- Make a playground - Use your playground skill. It should almost be a combination of the DSL and a level editor and then a renderer for the game. It should allow multiple levels of the game to be created.
- Create example games and place them in the examples folder. Make some example sprites and images to use. You are free to download opensource game artwork.
- There should be a compiled dist folder that the examples can use.
